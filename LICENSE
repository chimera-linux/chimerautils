Most of the code in this suite originates from FreeBSD and is provided under
identical terms as FreeBSD, which is mostly BSD-2-Clause.

Chimerautils also ships custom tools, which are likewise provided under the
same license but have a different copyright:

The license file in the original bsdutils project stated the whole is provided
under the BSD-3-Clause license. However, most of the work there has been
simple build adjustments which by themselves are not individually copyrightable,
and most of the non-trivial work has since been done here and/or rewritten.
Therefore, for simplicity, the whole is distributed under the same license
as FreeBSD.

The original tools that do not come from FreeBSD, as well as any custom glue
code has always been BSD-2-Clause.
